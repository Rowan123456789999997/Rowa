    <h1>Graphic communication</h1>
    <p>Graphic communication, within a university context, typically refers to a
      field of study that encompasses visual communication and design principles
      using various media. It involves the creation, manipulation, and presentation of
      visual messages to convey information, ideas, or concepts. This field integrates
      elements of graphic design, typography, illustration, branding, advertising, and
      digital media to communicate effectively across different mediums such as print, digital, or multimedia platforms.
      Students studying graphic communication often learn about design theory, color theory,
      layout, typography, and the use of various software tools essential for visual communication,
      such as Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc.). They explore how to combine
      text, images, and other visual elements to create compelling and effective communication pieces,
      ranging from logos and posters to websites and interactive media.
      The curriculum may also cover aspects of marketing, user experience (UX) design,
      and the role of visual communication in different industries, preparing students for careers
      in graphic design, advertising, branding, publishing, web design, and more. Overall, graphic
      communication programs aim to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively
      convey messages visually in today's diverse and constantly evolving communication landscape</p><li>
